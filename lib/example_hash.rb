     "\nEdinburgh Cocktail Week returns this Autumn, Monday 14th - Sunday 20th October, with its biggest and most exciting festival line-up yet including a new Cocktail Forest, Rooftop Cocktail Domes, an expanded Cocktail Village and over 70 of Edinburgh’s finest bars! \nFollowing its popular introduction to the festival last year, the Cocktail Village returns to Festival Square, acting as the social hub of the week-long festivities and is packed with 19 pop-up bars, music, masterclasses and entertainment. Entry is free with an ECW wristband and all cocktails inside are just £4 each from the likes of Edinburgh Gin, Patron Tequila, Absolut Vodka, Don Q Rum, Pickering’s Gin, Highland Park Whisky and many more. There’s also an exciting new Forest themed extension to explore - a dark enchanted space featuring a wigwam, fire pit, forest floor and canopy, giant toadstools and a twinkling night sky - inviting you and your friends to escape the city and go ‘camping with cocktails’. In addition to cocktails, there will also be a beer and soft drinks offering as well as a new outdoor street food area covered by a stretch tent.<U+200B>\n\nAnother exciting addition to this year’s festival are the Cocktail Domes on the rooftop garden of The Glasshouse Hotel (next to the Omni Centre). This is the first time these fully transparent domes will appear in Edinburgh, offering festivalgoers a unique opportunity to enjoy views of the city’s iconic skyline while snapping Instagram-worthy pictures and sipping on a menu of £4 cocktails. Each dome comfortably seats 8 people and will be styled with sofas, cushions, blankets and fairy lights to create a super-cute and cosy setting for guests to relax in. Entry to the rooftop garden is free with an Edinburgh Cocktail Week wristband but reservations are essential to secure exclusive use of a dome for you and your party. Demand for reservations has been very high - if reservations have sold out for the day you wish to attend, please note there are a number of free-to-enter domes available for walk-ins offered on a first-come basis, so please do still come along to the rooftop. You can enjoy drinks in the garden area & hotel bar while waiting for seats to become available.<U+200B>\nOver 70 of the city's top bars are taking part in this year's Edinburgh Cocktail Week, each creating a bespoke signature cocktail, which wristband holders can enjoy exclusively for £4 each with an ECW wristband. New bars taking part this year include Cold Town House, Cask Smugglers, Smoke & Mirrors, The Barologist, Camera, Damm 27 and The Garden, as well as returning favourites The Refinery, Harvey Nichols, Tigerlily, Tonic, Copper Blossom, The Voodoo Rooms and Brewhemia. This year also sees the introduction of non-alcoholic cocktails to the festival in partnership. There will be a handy map in the printed ECW Guide to help you navigate between bars and pop-up spaces. \nBetween visiting bars, the Cocktail Village, Forest space and Rooftop Domes, wristband holders can hop between a programme of events happening across the city including Morning Yoga with Seedlip overlooking Edinburgh Castle, a Classic Movie & Cocktails night at the Scotsman Picturehouse, bespoke tours of the newly opened Holyrood Distillery, an evening of cocktails aboard the stunning Fingal in Leith docks, an Edinburgh Gin Brunch Extravagaaaaanza, Cocktail Afternoon Tea at The Waldorf Astoria, and a Highland Park Rooftop Winter Terrace at Cold Town House, as well as masterclasses with Beefeater and Eden Mill throughout the week. \nWristbands are on sale now at www.edinburghcocktailweek.co.uk priced at £6 for a weekday wristband (valid Monday – Friday), £8 for a weekend wristband (valid Saturday & Sunday) and £13.50 for a week-long wristband.\n \nWristbands are on sale now:\nWeekday Wristband £6 (valid five days, Mon - Fri)\nWeekend Wristband £8 (valid two days, Sat & Sun)\nWeek-Long Wristband £13.50 (valid for seven days)\n \nOrder your wristband now at www.edinburghcocktailweek.co.uk\n \nHOTEL OFFER: Edinburgh Cocktail Week has partnered with Apex Hotels in Edinburgh to offer 10% off stays at any of their four city centre hotels (two are located at the Grassmarket, one at Waterloo Place and one at Haymarket).
